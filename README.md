# [DEPRECATED] Unofficial SDK

**This SDK is no longer maintained.**  
Its features and contributions have been merged into the [Official Zscaler Python SDK](https://github.com/zscaler/zscaler-sdk-python). Please refer to the official repository for all future development, documentation, and support.

Please see [the pyZscaler deprecation notice](https://github.com/mitchos/pyZscaler/discussions/306) for further information on this.

*Thank you to everyone who contributed, tested, and supported this project. Your efforts helped create a stronger, more unified solution now available in the official repository.*
