pyZscaler is an SDK that provides a uniform and easy-to-use interface for each of the Zscaler product APIs.

This SDK is not affiliated with, nor supported by Zscaler in any way.

## Quick links
* [pyZscaler API Documentation](https://pyzscaler.readthedocs.io)
* [pyZscaler User Documentation and Examples (WIP)](https://pyzscaler.packet.tech)

## Overview
Each Zscaler product has separate developer documentation and authentication methods. This SDK simplifies
software development using the Zscaler API.

This SDK leverages the [RESTfly framework](https://restfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) developed
by Steve McGrath.

## Features
- Simplified authentication with Zscaler APIs.
- Uniform interaction with all Zscaler APIs.
- Uses [python-box](https://github.com/cdgriffith/Box/wiki) to add dot notation access to json data structures.
- Zscaler API output automatically converted from CamelCase to Snake Case.
- Various quality of life enhancements for object CRUD methods.

## Products
- Zscaler Private Access (ZPA)
- Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA)
- Zscaler Mobile Admin Portal for Zscaler Client Connector (ZCC)
- Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) - (work in progress)


## Installation

The most recent version can be installed from pypi as per below.

    $ pip install pyzscaler

## Usage

Before you can interact with any of the Zscaler APIs, you may need to generate API keys or retrieve tenancy information
for each product that you are interfacing with. Once you have the requirements and you have installed pyZscaler,
you're ready to go.


### Quick ZIA Example

```python
from pyzscaler import ZIA
from pprint import pprint

zia = ZIA(api_key='API_KEY', cloud='CLOUD', username='USERNAME', password='PASSWORD')
for user in zia.users.list_users():
    pprint(user)
```

### Quick ZPA Example

```python
from pyzscaler import ZPA
from pprint import pprint

zpa = ZPA(client_id='CLIENT_ID', client_secret='CLIENT_SECRET', customer_id='CUSTOMER_ID')
for app_segment in zpa.app_segments.list_segments():
    pprint(app_segment)
```

### Quick ZCC Example

```python
from pyzscaler import ZCC
from pprint import pprint

zcc = ZCC(client_id='CLIENT_ID', client_secret='CLIENT_SECRET', company_id='COMPANY_ID')
for device in zcc.devices.list_devices():
    pprint(device)
```


## Documentation
### API Documentation
pyZscaler's API is fully 100% documented and is hosted at [ReadTheDocs](https://pyzscaler.readthedocs.io). 

This documentation should be used when working with pyZscaler rather than referring to Zscaler's API reference. 
pyZscaler makes some quality of life improvements to simplify and clarify arguments passed to Zscaler's API.

### User Documentation
A start has been made on [user documentation](https://pyzscaler.packet.tech) with examples and explanations on how to implement with pyZcaler.

## Is It Tested?
Yes! pyZscaler has a complete test suite that fully covers all methods within the ZIA and ZPA modules.

## Contributing

Contributions to pyZscaler are absolutely welcome.
